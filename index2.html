		  <h2>Inside my 'Kitchen'</h2>
		  <p>I love building things, I love creating things. I love working with people and brainstorming on a new project, writing down the plan. Even when the project takes all of my time, and has the frustrating and happy moments...I feel thrilled thinking about the end result and incredibly happy when it is achieved. I love to see the result of my team's work. I feel so happy and proud to be part of the work...Feel so lucky and happy to be part of the team. And recently I thought why not try building my own e-company? And than came DBC. And than I met my wonderful cohort. Every person is unique, every person has a great idea. And I am sure I will not only get the dev skills, but find new friends and, perhaps, become a part of the next Awesome startup </p>

<!-- using css.normalize because we know it's more battle tested and more reliable
browsers might create default styling and each browser may create it's own. We would like to get rid of that for creating the cross browser compatibility - called reset, to make sure the website looks the same for all browsers.
a link element allows us to share resources of one with another

grid system - helps to layout our page quickly, another advantage to create the design which will look professional
a grid is a common feature of many CSS frameworks
